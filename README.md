# TASK 1: 3D PRINTING!

I explored the working of a 3D printer and understood how models are prepared and printed. I learned what an STL file is and how it serves as the 3D model format for printing. Using slicing software (Bambu Studio and Creality slicer), I experimented with different settings such as bed temperature, layer height, and infill density to prepare the file for printing. I also went through the SOPs for operating the printer safely. Finally, I downloaded an STL file from the internet, sliced it.

# TASK 2: API

I learned about APIs, how they work, and their applications in different domains. I understood how APIs enable communication between applications and allow us to fetch or send data in real-time. To practice, I built a **cryptocurrency converter** web app using a cryptocurrency API. The interface allows the user to select a cryptocurrency, convert it into fiat currency, and display the live conversion rate. Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in making API calls, handling the response, and integrating it into a user-friendly interface.

## TASK 3: Working with GitHub

I familiarized myself with GitHub workflows including issues, pull requests, and GitHub Actions. I explored the given repository and went through the README instructions to complete the required steps. This helped me understand how collaborative development works, how issues are tracked and resolved, and how pull requests are reviewed before merging. I also learned the importance of version control and automation in maintaining a clean and efficient development workflow.

## TASK 4: Command Line on Ubuntu

I practiced working with the Ubuntu command line to strengthen my Linux basics. I created a folder named kkk, navigated into it using `cd`, and created a blank text file. I then listed files inside the folder and generated 2600 subfolders with unique names (like _M90_ or _B56_). Finally, I concatenated two text files and displayed their combined content directly in the terminal. This task gave me improved my knowledge in using shell commands for file management, automation, and text handling.

## TASK 5: Build Your Own Brain – Linear Regression from Scratch

I implemented Linear Regression from scratch to understand the mathematics behind machine learning models. Using gradient descent, I trained my own model on the California Housing dataset and compared its performance with `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`. I evaluated both models using standard metrics like MSE, MAE, and R², and also plotted the line of best fit with the datapoints. I observed how feature scaling and proper learning rate selection influenced training stability. Comparing my scratch model with scikit-learn’s implementation helped me appreciate the convenience and efficiency of built-in libraries, while also giving me a deeper grasp of gradient descent and optimization in ML.

## TASK 7: Create a Portfolio Webpage

I designed and developed a personal portfolio website to showcase my profile, interests, projects, and social media links. The webpage was made responsive so that it works across different devices. I used HTML, CSS, and a chosen framework for styling. Finally, I pushed the website to a GitHub repository, which helped me understand deployment and version control for web projects.

## TASK 8: Writing Resource Article using Markdown
I learned how to use Markdown for writing structured technical content. I wrote a technical resource article on a chosen topic, using Markdown to format headings, bullet points, links, and code snippets. This task taught me the importance of clean documentation and how Markdown makes writing consistent across devices.

# TASK 9: Tinkercad Simulation


For the task, I simulated a simple circuit using an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino UNO** to estimate the distance of an obstacle, and displayed the results on the serial monitor. Although I attempted to design a radar system, I could not fully simulate it since servo motor motion could not be implemented properly in Tinkercad. This task introduced me to Tinkercad, ultrasonic sensors, and their working principle.

## TASK 10: Speed Control of DC Motor

I learned how to control the speed of a DC motor using an Arduino UNO and an **L298N H-Bridge motor driver**. First, I simulated the circuit in Tinkercad to understand the logic. Later, I implemented the setup on real hardware using a 5V BO motor. By using PWM signals, I was able to vary the speed of the motor successfully. This task gave me a practical understanding of motor drivers and speed control techniques.

## TASK 11: LED Toggle Using ESP32

I explored the ESP32 microcontroller and learned how to configure the Arduino IDE to program it. I created a simple **web server** hosted on the ESP32 that allowed me to control an LED connected to one of its GPIO pins. By accessing the server from a browser, I could toggle the LED on and off. This task helped me understand how ESP32 can be used for IoT applications.

## TASK 12: Soldering Prerequisites

I learned about the different soldering tools available in the lab, including soldering irons, solder, flux, wick, and perf boards. Under the supervision of a coordinator, I practiced basic soldering by assembling a simple LED circuit on a perf board. This task gave me hands-on experience with soldering and improved my confidence in handling electronic components.

## TASK 13: 555 Astable Multivibrator

I designed a **555 timer astable multivibrator circuit** with a duty cycle of 60%. I rigged up the circuit on a breadboard and used probes to observe the output waveform on a DSO (Digital Storage Oscilloscope). This task helped me understand how the 555 timer operates in astable mode and how component values affect frequency and duty cycle.

-   Detection range: **10 ppm – 1000 ppm (varies per gas)**.
    
-   Long lifetime and low cost.
    

----------

#### Calibration and Operation

-   The sensor must be **pre-heated** for stable operation (24–48 hours initially).
    
-   Sensor resistance **Rs** is compared with a reference resistance **Ro** (in clean air).
    
-   Calibration is performed by exposing the sensor to known concentrations of gases and plotting Rs/Ro against gas concentration.

## Task 17: Introduction to VR
For this task, I studied the fundamentals of Virtual Reality (VR) and compared it with Augmented Reality (AR) to understand their differences in immersion, hardware, and applications. I explored the technology stack involved in VR such as headsets, tracking systems, engines like Unity/Unreal, and standards like OpenXR and WebXR. I also reviewed current trends in VR, including enterprise adoption, AI integration, and WebXR growth, while identifying Indian companies like Tata Elxsi, Imaginate, and AjnaLens that are active in this space. This helped me gain a detailed overview of VR, its applications, and the evolving ecosystem in India and worldwide.
